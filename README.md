- Holiday Search Section
	- This section is split into three parts.
	- The left hand side will take up 1/3rd of the screen and includes form asking the user travel details, and a calendar which is fully interactable with the user. They will be able to select a start date and a return date. Users will not be able to search for one-way journeys as it does not fit the purpose of the site. Once selecting both dates, the user will be able to click on the "Search" button.
